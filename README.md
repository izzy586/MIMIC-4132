# MIMIC-4132
A robotic mimic from the popular series Five Nights At Freddy's. Source code will go public when project releases!

I made it so you can print it out in either PLA or ABS. In this repo, youâ€™ll find all the STL files you need to print the parts and the code to control the movements. Itâ€™s meant to be simple enough to assemble, but you can also tweak it and make it your own.

As stated above, Code will remain obfuscated till the official release of the projectðŸ’¯
